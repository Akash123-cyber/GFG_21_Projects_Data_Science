# 📘 21 Weeks • 21 Projects — GeeksforGeeks Program

This repository contains all my work for the **GeeksforGeeks "21 Weeks, 21 Projects" program**.  
Each project corresponds to one week of learning and focuses on building strong foundations in **programming, data structures, algorithms, and applied development**.

---

## 🧭 Objective

The main purpose of this repository is to:
- Keep a structured record of each weekly project  
- Reinforce key Data Science concepts through practical implementation  
- Maintain concise documentation for future reference  
- Track my learning progress and improvements over time

## 🗂️ File Structure

This repository does **not use folders per week**.  
All files are stored directly in the root directory, named according to their corresponding week or project.
<br>Like |<br>"
     <br>|___> project week   ➡️ file_name.ipynb<br>
     <br>|___> week 1 project ➡️ w1_Data_Story_Telling.ipynb<br>
     <br>|___> week 2 project ➡️ w2_advance_EDA_Netflix.ipynb<br>
